# Chaos Ventures Landing Page

A minimalist, mysterious landing page for Chaos Ventures â€” built with HTML and Tailwind CSS.

## ðŸ§± Structure

- `index.html` â€“ main landing page
- `/assets/logo.svg` â€“ replaceable logo

## ðŸš€ Deployment Instructions (Vercel)

   Create a new repo and push the contents of this folder.

2. **Deploy with Vercel**  
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/)
   - Sign in with GitHub and import your new repo
   - Accept defaults (Framework = None / Static)
